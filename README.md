Title: Date Night Wishlisht

Description: 
This app is the perfect ledger for you to keep track of ideas and locations for dates that you'd like to go on, have went to or are interested in. It allows you to list the name of the location, the cost, and even add a picture. It was created to help you reduce those pesky notes in your phone that take up too much space. Now you can have your own personal website that logs everything!
